###Project Introduction
An app that is meant to help Pizza delivery drivers easily navigate their delivery. Using the PagAPI to access current Delivery information. 

###Project Background
The Pag Api provides current delivery information.
​
###Purpose Statement
An app that is meant to help Pizza delivery drivers easily navigate their delivery. 

###Scope of Work
On the /current_delivery page, all orders on the current delivery are displayed. Each order displays all relevant information - customer address, customer name, customer phone number, Order Tip. A link to google maps navigation to the orders address, and a link to dial the customers number.
On the schedules page, The schedule for the current user will be displayed.
On the all drives page, a driver will be able to edit tips on all previous deliveries stored on our server. Will also be able to click a customer id link to go to a customer profile and view their notes/location image
On the Dashboard/Stats page, I will have various metrics, possibly including: 
    • Avg tip$/hr over the last week
    • Num of dels total
    • Avg tip$/del
    • Avg num of dels/day of week
    • Avg Tip$/hr organized by day of week
